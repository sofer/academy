  <dt>What is Collective Academy?</dt>
  <dd>We are part of <a href="http://camdencollective.co.uk/">Collective</a>, run by Camden Town Unlimited, the Business Improvement District for Camden Town.</dd>

  <dt>What courses are offered at Collective Academy?</dt>
  <dd>The first cohort on our full-time 6-week <a href="http://camdencollective.co.uk/academy/">Coding the web</a> course starts in January 2014. More courses are planned.</dd>

  <dt>Who are the courses suitable for?</dt>
  <dd>Our courses are for you if: You are thinking about a career as a software developer. Or you want to be able to use software in your work. Or you want to work on your own software projects for fun or profit.</dd>

  <dt>How much does it cost to attend Collective Academy?</dt>
  <dd>Courses are currently free to individuals. We hope to keep it that way.</dd>

  <dt>I like the sound of this, but I cannot study full-time. Are you offering any other courses?</dt>
  <dd>We will be. Please <a href="mailto:collective-academy+subscribe@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">join our mailing list</a>. We are concentrating on the full-time course for now, but we will be doing part-time versions of the course soon.</dd>

  <dt>Are there any restrictions on who can apply to study at Collective Academy?</dt>
  <dd>Anyone over the age of 18 can apply. Some applicants might get priority if they meet the criteria of our funding partners.</dd>

  <dt>How do I apply?</dt>
  <dd>The application form is <a href="http://camdencollective.co.uk/academy/">here</a>.</dd>

  <dt>What are the entry requirements?</dt>
  <dd>There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning our courses require. You need to be self-motivated and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a certain analytical way of thinking that comes easier to some people than others. Above all, you need to follow the First Rule of Collective: Don't be an arse.</dd>

<!--
  <dt>What is the First Rule of Collective?</dt>
  <dd>Don't be an arse.<> In other words, If you do not know, then Collective Academy may not be for you, but here are a few pointers: Treat everyone at Collective with kindness and courtesy. Do not make remarks that are likely to be offensive to others. No subtle sexism (or any "isms", for that matter). Do not put people down. Do not attempt to justify yourself when your behaviour is challenged, just apologise and move on. Encourage each other.</dd>

  <dt>What sort of put-downs do I particularly need to look out for?</dt>
  <dd>This is an important question. Here are some examples: No feigning surprise, like "What?! I can't believe you don't know that?". No "Well-actually"s, as in "Well, actually, that's not the way you do it". No offering advice that hasn't been asked for.</dd>

-->
  <dt>What does the course consist of?</dt>
  <dd>The course begins with a series of guided programming assignments and ends with self-directed group-based project work.</dd>

  <dt>Who does the teaching?</dt>
  <dd>There is no teacher. The course facilitator is Dan Sofer, who will guide you through the course material, answer questions, pair program with you, lead code reviews, help you choose a project to work on, act as a sounding board for ideas, and ensure that the environment is conducive to serious study and creative collaboration. We also encourage our students to learn from each other.</dd>

  <!--
  <dt>How are we expected to help each other?</dt>
  <dd>Every now and again take your headphones off and look up from your work and make your self available. When somebody asks for help with a problem, don't be too quick to tell them the answer. Always start by giving them time to explain their understanding of the problem. Often just the act of explaining a problem can reveal the answer. It can also be useful to use another student's question to come up with a new way of answering a question, instead of just repeating the answer that you think you already know. Above all, treat other peopleâ€™s questions as a learning experience for both of you. If you have not tried it before, it is surprising how useful to your own understanding of a problem explaining it to somebody else can be.</dd>

  <dt>What is pair programming?</dt>
  <dd>Just what it sounds like. It is programming in pairs, with one person on the keyboard typing the code and the other person next to them discussing the problem as they work on it together.</dd>

  <dt>What is a code review?</dt>
  <dd>Just what it sounds like. It is when two or more people look at and discuss a piece of code together after it has been written.</dd>
-->
  <dt>What happens after the course ends?</dt>
  <dd>You will join our alumni network. We encourage you to self-organise into study groups. We will provide advice, support, space and mentoring support. We want to help you achieve your educational, vocational and work goals, whatever they may be.</dd>

   <dt>I want to work on my own startup idea after the course. Can you help?</dt>
  <dd>Alumni of the Academy that are serious about starting up their own business can get fast-track membership of Collective with all the benefits that provides, including free hot-desking space, participation in the Accelerator programme and access to a wider community of fellow founders and business mentors.</dd>

  <dt>I am an experienced coder and want to get involved.</dt>
  <dd>We want to hear from you. Please get in touch. We are particularly keen to hear from you if you are interested in speaking to our students and alumni about your particular area of expertise or in acting as a mentor.</dd>
  
  <dt>I am from a company interested in meeting your students and alumni.</dt>
  <dd>Please get in touch. We are particularly keen to hear from you if you are interested in coming to speak to us about your company, the work you do, and the skills that your company needs.</dd>
